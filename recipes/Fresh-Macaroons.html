        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Fantabulous colored, bite-sized macaroons. Divide batter into thirds and color one-third pink <br>and flavor with raspberry flavoring; color one-third yellow and flavor with<br>lemon flavoring; color one-third pale blue and flavor with vanilla. Fill and make<br>sandwich cookies with filling of choice, like peach jam or strawberry preserves.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 egg whites</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons superfine (castor) sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup finely ground almonds</li>
                <li>1½ teaspoons finely ground almonds</li>
                <li>1⅓ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicon mat.</li>
                    <li>Whisk egg whites in a clean metal mixing bowl until thick, about 5 minutes; whisk the<br>superfine sugar into the egg whites until thick, glossy, and the mixture holds stiff<br>peaks, 5 to 8 more minutes. Place a sieve over the bowl containing egg whites and<br>sieve both amounts of almond meal and confectioners' sugar into the egg white mixture.<br>Gently fold the almond meal and confectioners' sugar into the egg whites, retaining<br>as much air as possible.</li>
                    <li>Separate the meringue into separate bowls to flavor and color, if desired. Spoon the<br>meringue into a piping bag fitted with a 3/8-inch tip. Pipe 1-inch disks of meringue<br>onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between cookies.</li>
                    <li>Let the cookies stand at room temperature for about 15 minutes to form a thin skin. <br>Pick up the baking sheets and let drop from several inches above the work surface <br>to adhere cookies to the baking sheets.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dry, about 15 minutes; let cool <br>completely on the baking sheets before peeling off the parchment paper.</li>
                </ol>
