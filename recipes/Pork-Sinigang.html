                <li>1 bunch bok choy or pechay, ends trimmed and separated into leaves</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rinse pork ribs and drain well.</li>
                    <li>In a pot over medium heat, combine pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that accumulates on top.</li>
                    <li>Once broth clears, add tomatoes, onion, and fish sauce. Lower heat and simmer for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until meat is tender, adding more water as necessary to maintain about 8 cups.</li>
                    <li>Add gabi and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes or until tender.</li>
                    <li>Add chili peppers and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add long beans. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add eggplant and okra and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>If using packaged tamarind base, add to the pot and stir until completely dissolved.</li>
                    <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>Add bok choy and continue to cook for about 1 minute. Serve hot.</li>
