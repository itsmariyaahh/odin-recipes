            <ul>
                <li>24 slices French baguette</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
                <li>2 cups chopped fresh strawberries</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven's broiler. Spread a thin layer of butter on each slice of bread. Arrange bread slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Place bread under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, just until lightly toasted. Spoon some chopped strawberries onto each piece of toast, then sprinkle sugar over the strawberries.</li>
                    <li>Place under the broiler again until sugar is caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
